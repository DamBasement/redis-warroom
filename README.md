# 🗺️ Overview
A curated collection of attack flows, field notes, and hands-on exploits
covering Redis misconfigurations, ACL abuse, replication attacks, and Lua RCE.

No dashboards.  
No shiny GUIs.  
Just raw CLI and config abuse.  
Perfect for red teamers, OSCP/OSWE prep, or anyone who thinks memory is public property.

# 🧰 Tools in Use
redis-cli  
nmap + NSE (redis-info, redis-brute)  
netcat (banner grab, gopher payloads)  
Metasploit (replication RCE)  
Custom rogue-server PoC  
tshark/Wireshark for traffic inspection  

🧪 Attack Philosophy
Manual attacks only  
No “auto-exploit” one-click toys  
Start from PONG, end with shell  
Emphasis on chaining: write → file → execution
